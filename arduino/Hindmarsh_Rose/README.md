This is Bioneuruino, a library in C++ for Arduino. It provides an implementation of different neuron models, as well as the implementation of a synapsys model. It has been developed as a part of the final degree project of Marc Bauz√†.

It allows for the physical implementation of the model in an actual board, with pins defined in the library.

The different models implemented currently are:
